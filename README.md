This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js HTTP servers: the lack of error handling when starting the server. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with improved error handling.  The solution demonstrates best practices for handling potential server startup failures, preventing unexpected crashes and providing informative error messages.
